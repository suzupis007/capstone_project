Team Beta capstone project for Merrimack College, Masters in Data Science Program, focusing on using social Determinants of Health to predict quality of life in US Counties. 
Research question: “How do social determinants of health affect quality of life in different localities”?.
Hypothesis: Social determinants of health, such as economic stability, social connectedness,access to healthcare, and neighborhood environment, significantly predict self-reported healthstatus in US counties.
Prediction: US counties with higher economic security, stronger social support infrastructure,better access to healthcare services, and safer, more accessible neighborhoods will report better overall health status compared to counties lacking these social determinants.
